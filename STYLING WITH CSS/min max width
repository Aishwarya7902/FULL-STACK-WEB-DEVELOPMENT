-> for any div if we set 
min-width:150px;
then it simply means if our screen resizes then the width of our div will not fall below 150px

-> similarly we can use max-width:150px;
min and max width are used to put constraint on elements that their size does not fall below a certain or it may not
grow beyond a certain size


-> similarly we can use min and max heigth
-> we can change overflow value as visible,hidden,scroll,auto...for auto browser will decide what will happen
