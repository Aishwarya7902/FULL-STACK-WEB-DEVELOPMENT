1-lets say you made an outer div and within that div you placed certain divs......if u increse the number of inner divs...then the divs will shrink to adjust themselves 
to fit into the outer div...if u wanna avoid these..and want that whatever dimension u have give to the inner div will be applied to them....
then u will have to use the flex-wrap property.

2.by defalut
flex-wrap: nowrap;

3.if u want they come in multiple line
use
flex-wrap: wrap;
so now every inner div will consume 250px as we have mentioned in the css file

4.if div overflows...set heigth to be auto

5.the way we have wrap ...we can have wrap-reverse as well to wrap in reverse order.
earlier elements were
1,2,3,4
5
after wrap
5
1,2,3,4

6.u can play around with and see the changes
flex-direction:row-reverse;
flex-wrap: wrap;
u can play around with column too.
