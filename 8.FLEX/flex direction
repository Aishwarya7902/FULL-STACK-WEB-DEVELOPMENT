1__by default elements are placed horizontally
2__default direction is row direction
3__if you want to change it 
flex-direction: column;
4__flex-direction:row;
how is the sequence of divs decided.....??
ans is the order in which you place the div in the html file like this
<div id="container">
	<div id="div1">
		Div 1
	</div>
	<div id="div2">
		Div 2
	</div>
	<div id="div3">
		Div 3
	</div>
	<div id="div4">
		Div 4
	</div>
</div>
so from left to right order will be div1,div2,div3,div4

IF U WANNA REVERSE THE ORDER USE:flex-direction:row-reverse;
by this elements will be placed from left to right as div4,div3,div2,div1

SIMILARLY WE CAN USE COLUMN REVERSE.
THIS IS HOW WE CAN CONTROL SEQUENCE OF CHILDREN.

5__IF YOU WANNA CHANGE THE ORDER OF CHILDREN WRITTEN IN HTML FILE USE "ORDER" IN CSS FILE
earlier all div had order 0 and when all div have same order then they come n the same sequence in which they are written in html file
#div1{
	background-color:yellow ;
}
#div2{
	background-color:pink ;
	order: 1;
}
#div3{
	background-color:cyan ;
}
#div4{
	background-color:lightgreen ;
}

by doing this order will be div1 ,div3,div4,div2
since div 2 has order greater than all rest ,hence it will come in the last ,rest three have same order with 0 as default so they will be placed as they come in html file.
6__IF YOU WANNA SEND DIV3 TO THE LAST ...SIMPLY SET ITS ORDER HIGHEST OF THE REST.
