1.this will align items across cross axis
so what do u mean by cross axis

cross axis is axis which is perpendicular to the main axis

2.lets say there is row ...so main axis is left to right ..then cross axis will be top to botttom
3.for column ....main axis is top to bottom...so cross axis is left to right
4.for column reverse main axis is bottom to top....so cross axis is right to left
5.There are five value that align items can actually take
A.flex-start
B.flex-end -this will bring items to the end of the cross axis
C.center
D.baseline- if u set different margins for different elements ...then by baseline all will be aligned on the same baseline.
E.stretch-it stretches item across cross axis(only if height is set to be auto)
we can set min and max heght too

6.IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO USE JUSTIFY CONTENT AND ALIGN ITEMS AT THE SAME TIME.
