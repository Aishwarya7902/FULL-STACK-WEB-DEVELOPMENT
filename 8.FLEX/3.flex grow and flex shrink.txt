1.if elements have more space then they can grow to occupy the extra space
if elements have less space then they can shrink to occupy the less space
this felxibiltiy is what flex actually offers us. 

2.flex grow means ....the element will grow accordingly the ratio given to it...to adjust the extra space available.
eg 
#div1{
	background-color:yellow ;
	flex-grow: 1;
}
#div2{
	background-color:pink ;
	flex-grow: 1;
}
lets say 100px of extra space is available then half of 100px will be shared by div1 and half of 100px will be shared by div2.
note : u may ask how this half of 100px came 
since ratio of grow for two divs was 1:1
hence (1/1+1)*100px

if ratio had been 4:1
then for div1 grown size=( 4/(4+1) )*100=80px
     for div2 grown size=( 1/(4+1) )*100=20px
     
3. the way we have flex grow ....we have flex shrink as well
what it does is if there is less availability of space then elements will shrink according to the ratios given to them.
