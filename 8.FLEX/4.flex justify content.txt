IN THIS WE WILL LEARN WHAT EXACTLY JUSTIFY CONTENT PROPERTY OF FLEXBOX IS

1.it is used to decide or adjust alignment of elements within flexbox
-> wheather u want to align them towards the beginning of flexbox
-> or towards the end
-> or u want to distribute the space available equally between the elements or around the flexbox elements
all the above points can be decided with the help of justify content

2. justify content decides alignment across the main axis

u may ask me what is main axis...so lets discuss
-> if flex direction is row then main axis  from left to right
-> if flex direction is row-reverse then main axis  from  right to left 
-> if flex direction is column then main axis  from top to bottom
-> if flex direction is column-reverse then main axis  from bottom to top 

3.by default main axis is from left to right

4.justify content can take five different values

A.justify-content: flex-start;
this is the default value....by using this elements will start from the beginning of flexbox

B.justify-content: flex-end;
this will align the elemnts towards the end of the flexbox

C.justify-content:center;
this will align the elemnts towards the center of the flexbox

D.justify-content:space-around;
this will try to achieve equal space around every element
space between two divs will be obviously more coz both div will leave some space around it..hence space of both gets added up.

E.justify-content:space-between;
it will achieve equal space between the elements and not around the elements
