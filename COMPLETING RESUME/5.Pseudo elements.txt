1.pseudo elements are used to style elements or u can say certain parts of an element 
2.lets say u have a paragraph and u want to style first letter of paragraph.....u can do this
p::first-letter{
	font-size: 2rem;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-transform: capitalize;
}

3.if u want to apply above style only to some p tags and not to all p tags...u can do this
.styled-first-letter::first-letter{
	font-size: 2rem;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-transform: capitalize;
}

4.or lets say u wanna style first line of paragraph

5.before and after pseudo class are used to add content before and after the content of an element
p::before{
	content: 'Before';
	font-size: 2rem;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-transform: capitalize;
}
above code means whatever is the content of p tag it will add 'Before'  before its content
in the similar way we have after which works in similar way as before
p::after{
	content: 'After';
	font-size: 2rem;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-transform: capitalize;
}
