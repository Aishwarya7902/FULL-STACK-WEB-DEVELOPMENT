1.gradient effect is a effect like there is a transition from blue to purple and something like that
minimu two color stops are needed to see this effect

2.using gradient we can crate pretty cool backgrounds

3.by writing this
#container{
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	border: 2px solid  black;
	background-image:linear-gradient(red,blue) ;
}
blue starts after 50%

background-image:linear-gradient(red,blue 20%) ;
IN THIS BLUE STARTS FROM 20%

4.we can write like this also
background-image:linear-gradient(red,blue 20px) ;

5.currently direction of gradient is towards bottom
u can do like this too
background-image:linear-gradient(to right,red,blue ) ;

u can do this too
background-image:linear-gradient(to top right,red,blue ) ;

u can do this too
background-image:linear-gradient(105deg,red,blue ) ;

u can give -ve degrees too

6.we can set repeating linear gradient too
background:repeating-linear-gradient(red,blue,20px ) ;
here we can use directions too

7.we can set radial gradient too
