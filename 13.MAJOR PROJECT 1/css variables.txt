1.so why we create css variable......?
it's so because while making trials we will have to make changes at many places ...hence this is a very 
painful task

2.sytax for using  a variable
// we are using root here because we want to use this variable in the entire document 
:root{
   --section-color-blue:#2857a4
}

//section-color-blue is a variable name .

3.how to use this variable 
so wherever u want to use this variable in color instead of using the hexcode write as

color:var(--section-color-blue);

4.if u wanna try and test...just change the value of the variable...and changes will be reflected at each
and every place.

5.note :not all modern browsers support css variables.
