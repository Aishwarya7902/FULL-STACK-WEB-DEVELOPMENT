1.Use Bootstrap’s JavaScript modal plugin to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.

2.How it works
Before getting started with Bootstrap’s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.

Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <body> so that modal content scrolls instead.
Clicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal.
Bootstrap only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals aren’t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.
Modals use position: fixed, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a .modal within another fixed element.
Once again, due to position: fixed, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices. See our browser support docs for details.
Due to how HTML5 defines its semantics, the autofocus HTML attribute has no effect in Bootstrap modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:

3.You can also create a scrollable modal that allows scroll the modal body by adding .modal-dialog-scrollable to .modal-dialog.

4.Tooltips and popovers can be placed within modals as needed. When modals are closed, any tooltips and popovers within are also automatically dismissed
