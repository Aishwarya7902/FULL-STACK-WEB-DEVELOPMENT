1.while creating layouts grid system is something which u should definately know.
2.grid system contains containers.
3.every container will have rows and columns
4. every grid is a 12 column grid
5.u can specify postion of an element where u wanna place it in the grid.
6.with the help of grids designing of a layout becomes very clear.
7.by default element will take the whole 12 columns.
8.by default the element will not cover the whole window ....it will have some margin
9.if u want that the element covers the whole window u can customise it
